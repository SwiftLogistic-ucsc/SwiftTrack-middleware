# SwiftTrack Driver Service

## Overview

The Driver Service is a dedicated microservice within the SwiftTrack middleware that handles all driver-related operations for Swift Logistics. It provides comprehensive functionality for delivery management, real-time tracking, and proof of delivery collection.

## Key Features

### üìã Delivery Manifest Management

- **Daily Route Assignment**: Drivers can view their optimized delivery route for the day
- **Package Details**: Complete information about each delivery including customer details, time windows, and special instructions
- **Real-time Status Tracking**: Live updates on delivery progress and completion status

### ‚ö° Real-time Updates

- **Route Optimization**: Live traffic updates and route modifications
- **Priority Deliveries**: Instant notifications for new high-priority packages
- **WebSocket Communication**: Real-time bidirectional communication with the driver app

### üì∏ Proof of Delivery (POD)

- **Photo Capture**: Upload multiple photos as delivery proof
- **Digital Signatures**: Capture customer signatures for package confirmation
- **Customer Information**: Record customer names and delivery notes
- **Secure Storage**: All proof files are securely stored with metadata

### üìç Location Tracking

- **Real-time GPS**: Continuous location updates from driver devices
- **Route Monitoring**: Track driver progress along optimized routes
- **Geofencing**: Location-based delivery confirmations

## API Endpoints

### Driver Manifest

```
GET /api/drivers/{driverId}/manifest
```

Retrieves the driver's daily delivery manifest with optimized route.

### Delivery Status Updates

```
PUT /api/drivers/{driverId}/deliveries/{packageId}/status
```

Updates package delivery status (DELIVERED, FAILED, ATTEMPTED).

### Proof of Delivery Upload

```
POST /api/drivers/{driverId}/deliveries/{packageId}/proof
```

Uploads delivery photos and digital signatures.

### Route Updates

```
GET /api/drivers/{driverId}/route-updates
```

Fetches real-time route updates and traffic information.

## WebSocket Events

### Client to Server

- `driver-login`: Join driver-specific channel
- `location-update`: Send GPS coordinates
- `delivery-status-change`: Update package status

### Server to Client

- `delivery-status-update`: Broadcast status changes
- `route-update`: Send route modifications
- `proof-of-delivery-uploaded`: Confirm POD upload

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO for WebSocket communication
- **File Upload**: Multer for photo/signature handling
- **Messaging**: Kafka for event-driven architecture
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with responsive design

## Integration Points

### With Order Service

- Receives delivery assignments from order processing workflow
- Updates order status based on delivery completion

### With Route Optimization Service (ROS)

- Consumes optimized routes and real-time updates
- Feeds back delivery completion data for route learning

### With Notification Service

- Triggers customer notifications on delivery status changes
- Sends alerts for failed deliveries or delays

### With Warehouse Management System (WMS)

- Confirms package pickup from warehouse
- Updates inventory on successful deliveries

## Security Features

- **File Validation**: Strict file type and size validation for uploads
- **Authentication**: Driver ID validation for all operations
- **Secure Storage**: Encrypted storage for sensitive delivery data
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of all driver actions

## Scalability Considerations

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless design allows multiple service instances
- **Load Balancing**: WebSocket sessions can be distributed across instances
- **Data Partitioning**: Driver data can be partitioned by region or route
- **Caching**: Frequently accessed route data is cached for performance

## Deployment

### Standalone Deployment

```bash
cd services/driver-service
npm install
npm start
```

### Docker Deployment

```bash
docker-compose up driver-service
```

### Environment Variables

- `PORT`: Service port (default: 4001)
- `KAFKA_BROKER`: Kafka broker connection string
- `UPLOAD_DIR`: Directory for proof of delivery files

## Monitoring and Observability

- **Health Checks**: `/health` endpoint for service monitoring
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logs with correlation IDs
- **Metrics**: Real-time metrics on delivery performance
- **Alerting**: Automated alerts for failed deliveries or system issues

## Future Enhancements

- **Mobile App Integration**: Native iOS/Android driver applications
- **Offline Capability**: Local storage for areas with poor connectivity
- **AI-Powered Routing**: Machine learning for route optimization
- **Voice Commands**: Hands-free delivery status updates
- **Predictive Analytics**: Delivery time predictions based on historical data

## Architecture Benefits

### Separation of Concerns

- **Dedicated Service**: Driver operations are isolated from order processing
- **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one domain area
- **Independent Scaling**: Driver service can scale based on driver count

### Event-Driven Design

- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via Kafka events
- **Resilience**: System continues functioning if individual services fail
- **Real-time Updates**: All stakeholders receive immediate status updates

### Microservices Benefits

- **Technology Flexibility**: Can use different tech stacks per service
- **Team Ownership**: Different teams can own different services
- **Deployment Independence**: Services can be deployed independently

This Driver Service demonstrates how SwiftTrack's microservices architecture enables specialized, scalable solutions for complex logistics operations while maintaining system-wide integration and real-time capabilities.
